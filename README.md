Download the project from the repository.

Run the Main.java file on the path:

 `./src/com/ironhack/homework_2/main`

## Introduction

Currently, companies seek to be able to deal with their customers on a one-to-one basis and thus be able to provide a better service with a shorter response time. In order to achieve this, this CRM (Customer Relationship Manager) was born as a collaborative assignment for the Ironhack bootcamp. This program aims to improve the relationship management with customers of a company that sells trucks. The software allows you to keep track of all prospects, contacts, opportunities and accounts; and update information about each database entry.

### Functions

* Lead management, tracking and status
* Creating contacts when a potential customer is interested in purchasing a product 
* Opportunities management
* Accounts management
* Save all changes made in the CRM

## Menu

This Menu consists of an interpreter that listens and recognizes keywords that allow the user to create, update or delete data. It can also display information to help the user navigate the software. Once a CRM operation has been selected, the menu prompts you to enter information about the topic of interest. Once you have finished using the CRM, it gives you the option to exit the program and save the entered records.

### How to navigate the menu

In order to navigate through the CRM, the user must enter the corresponding command to execute the action.

```
Enter help for a list of valid commands!
Enter exit to close the application!

```


- If the player wants to see the commands of the CRM, he must input: **help**.
- If the player wants to exit the program, he must input: **exit**.

## Help menu

If you typed **help**, the menu with all commands shows up.

```
“new lead” – to create a new Lead  
“convert <ID>”– to convert a Lead into an Opportunity    
“close-won <ID>”– for changing the Opportunity status to Close Won      
“close-lost <ID>”– for changing the Opportunity status to Close Lost
“lookup <OBJECT> <ID>”- to search for specific Lead, Opportunity, Account or Contact
“show <OBJECT PLURAL>” - to list all Leads, Opportunities, Accounts or Contacts
“help” – to show information that explains usage of available commands (the same as you see)

“save” – to save the changed data   
“exit” – to save and exit the program

```
-	where ID is a valid number assigned to one of the Leads/Opportunities in the database
-	where OBJECT is **Lead**, **Opportunity**, **Account** or **Contact**
-	where OBJECT PLURAL is **Leads**, **Opportunities**, **Accounts** or **Contacts**

## Description of the CRM Components

### Lead

Lead will be understood as a prospect, that is, a person who shows interest in the product. It is important to keep in mind that lead is the first instance of the relationship with a potential client. In the next section we will see what attributes a lead has.

### Contact

When a prospect or lead, in addition to showing interest, already requests a quote, then the Contact is generated, which will have the information of the lead.

### Opportunity

Let's understand an opportunity as a possible transaction between the client and the company, the opportunity has three possible states, these are:
* OPEN (if the client has not yet decided whether or not to accept the quote)
* CLOSED_WON (if the client accepted the quote)
* CLOSED_LOST (if the client did not accept the quote)

### Account

An account is the most detailed record of the client who has requested a quote or inquiry. This means that it is stored as a potential customer in the CRM history.
